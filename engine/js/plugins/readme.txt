Plugins for Annotator
-- 

Pretty simple at the moment - add a new object to window.annotate_tools (if you need one, for example as a mutex or a function).
You can then use jQuery (which is available to plugins) to hook events on to the DOM related to annotator.

You can use this to fire analytics, for example.
