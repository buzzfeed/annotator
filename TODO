To fix:

Dual: Split out the positioning and drawing functions so the builder and the engine can both use them.
Builder: Ability to edit or delete annotations which have been entered
Builder: Ability to move the annotation point w/mouse after it's created vs using X and Y coordinates
Builder: Remove colour picker, offer brand colours on a swatch with opacity configuration only

Additional tasks: Engine:

  Add line width as a configurable item
  Add "appear at top" and "appear at bottom" support, so not all annotations have to appear below

Additional tasks: Builder:

  Ability to host images on BuzzFeed's servers
  Ability to edit an entire existing embed
  Ability to configure an annotation to "appear at top" or "appear at bottom"
  Being able to easily bold, ital, or hyperlink within the annotations w/o using HTML.
  Other ways to annotate; a Highlighter style for annotating a phrase or line, or a rectangle.
